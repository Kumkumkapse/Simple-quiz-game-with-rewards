# Simple Quiz Game with Rewards

## Project Description

The Simple Quiz Game with Rewards is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to participate in quiz games and earn cryptocurrency rewards for correct answers. This smart contract-based game provides a transparent, trustless environment where players can test their knowledge across various topics while earning ETH rewards.

The game operates on a simple mechanism: the contract owner adds questions with multiple-choice answers, players submit their responses, and those who answer correctly receive predetermined ETH rewards. All transactions and game logic are handled transparently on the blockchain, ensuring fairness and immutability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create an engaging, educational, and rewarding platform that combines learning with blockchain technology. We aim to:

- **Democratize Learning**: Make education accessible and rewarding for everyone, regardless of geographical location or economic background
- **Promote Blockchain Adoption**: Introduce users to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology through an intuitive gaming experience
- **Create a Sustainable Ecosystem**: Build a self-sustaining platform where community contributions fund ongoing rewards
- **Foster Knowledge Sharing**: Encourage continuous learning by making education financially rewarding

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix)
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Test ETH for deployment and testing

### Deployment Steps
1. Compile the contract using your preferred development environment
2. Deploy to your chosen network (testnet recommended for initial testing)
3. Fund the contract with initial ETH for rewards
4. Add initial questions using the `addQuestion()` function
5. Share the contract address with players

### Usage Examples
```solidity
// Add a question (owner only)
addQuestion(
    "What is the capital of France?",
    ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
    2 // Paris is at index 2
);

// Answer a question
answerQuestion(0, 2); // Question ID 0, Answer index 2

// Claim rewards
claimRewards();
```
